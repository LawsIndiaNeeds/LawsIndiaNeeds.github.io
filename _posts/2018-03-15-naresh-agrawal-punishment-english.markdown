Lok Sabha MPs through majority vote can bypass courts and directly imprison anyone (including Supreme Court judges) by majority vote.

One precedent is Lok Sabha in Dec-1978 had voted on a motion to suspend Devi Indira Amma from parliament for a few days and also **imprison** her. The motion was passed with a simple majority and after that, Devi Indira Amma was imprisoned. And due to heavy protests across India, she had to be released.

[Link to Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/20/parliament-expels-grandhi-orders-her-to-delhi-jail-cell/2564b899-f0bc-473c-950e-4c29f1767e49/?utm_term=.3ce7c1118301)

The above news link by: **Richard M. Weintraub** *December 20, 1978* says:

>The lower house then went into sessions to take up the case and voted 279 to 138 yesterday on a motion introduced by Desai to strip Gandhi of her seat and imprison her for the duration of the current session. Thirty-seven members abstained.
>
>Since the parliamentary session is to end this week, she could be in jail for as few as three days.

The above link is US newspaper Washington Post, I generally like to confine to Indian sources, but I could not find Indian source on this issue. Because this is 1978 event and few Indian newspapers etc. have put contents of those days online.

Supreme Court judges cannot void imprisonment order issued by Lok Sabha. Because Supreme Court judges can void ONLY an order of Higher Court or Lower Court, not Parliament. Also, Lok Sabha can imprison all Supreme Court judges, so Supreme Court judges better not clash with Lok Sabha. If worst comes to worst, Prime Minister can ask Military to imprison Supreme Court judges and Military is outside the jurisdiction of the court i.e. any case against soldier can be moved to court only after Military approves.

When Naresh Agrawal had insulted Shri Ram, Sita Mata etc in Rajya Sabha, ***RSS MPs*** could have used this power to **imprison** Naresh Agrawal but they didn't.

Courts can't imprison an MP for a speech made in the Parliament, but Lok Sabha MPs can.

### **Solution:** "Jury Trial over MPs" wherein 1500 Jurors chosen from across India can imprison MP for insulting speech made by MP in Parliament or other crime done in Parliament.
